<p>Extremely beautiful and breathtaking scenery. I wish Pandora was real.</p>
<h3>Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith</h3>
<p>
  Even though it was tragic and sad to see the fall of Anakin, it was exciting
  to see the birth of Darth Vader.
</p>
<h3>Spider-Man: No Way Home</h3>
<p>Really cool to see all 3 Spider-Man together in one film.</p>
